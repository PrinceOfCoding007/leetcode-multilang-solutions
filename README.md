# 🏆 LeetCode Tracker & Progress Dashboard

Welcome to my **LeetCode Tracker** repository! 🚀  

This repo is a **personal LeetCode dashboard** to track daily progress, visualize solved problems, analyze strengths & weaknesses across **languages, topics, difficulty, and companies**, and store solutions in **Python, Java, and C#**.

---

## 🎯 Features

### **1️⃣ Daily Progress Tracking**
- Track all solved problems with:
  - **Date, Problem, Topic, Difficulty**
  - **Completion status per language** (Python / Java / C#)
  - **Companies** (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.)
  - **Time taken & Notes**
  - **LeetCode problem link**  
- Automatically calculates **daily streaks** and **trends over time**.

### **2️⃣ Interactive Visualizations**
- **Language Breakdown** → Donut chart showing percentage of problems solved per language  
- **Problems by Difficulty** → Grouped bar chart  
- **Problems by Topic** → Horizontal bar chart showing mastery per topic  
- **Daily Trend** → Line chart with markers for each language  
- **Time Analysis** → Box plots per difficulty for time taken  
- **Company Analysis** → Grouped bar & bubble charts showing topic vs company coverage  

> All charts are **interactive using Plotly** and fallback to static images if needed.

### **3️⃣ Multi-Language Solutions**
- **Python / Java / C# solutions** for every problem
- Named using **problem number + name** convention, e.g.:  
  `11_Container_With_Most_Water.py`  

### **4️⃣ Insights & Learning**
- Quickly see **weak topics** per language  
- Track **company-focused problems**  
- Monitor **problem-solving speed** and trends  
- Identify **streaks and progress patterns**
